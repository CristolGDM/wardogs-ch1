I believe you can't make a RPG without being able to make FF6; and you can't make FF6 without making at least a dungeon and a dialog.

This is my attempt at making a dungeon and a dialog (two dialogs even).

This was done with RPG Maker MV. My original plan was to use it as a placeholder, then replace evrything with my own assets. As you will see pretty fast, this isn't what happened.

I realized that making assets was hard. Took me months to make the main character, and it killed my motivation when I realized I still had to do the secondary character AND the monsters AND the combat sprites AND the weapons AND the combat animations AND the items AND the tiles. And then I could start coding.

So this game has one original sprite. That's it. It's a very good one though

## What I learned

- Doing sprites takes time
- You probably have to do more sprites than you think
- Pixelart is great, and is probably easier to start than 3D or normal drawing. But it doesn't scale well: once you get a 3D model, every animation you make uses the same model, and cover all directions. Pixelart means you have to do every single frame of every single direction.
- It increases exponentially: every character you add means more walking/running/idle animations, for four directions, more combat sprites, more combat animations, etc. Even deciding to add a different running animation, or to add one more frames to animation is a significant amount of work
- My advice: measure how long it takes you to do a frame, a tile, and take it into account when deciding how many animations/characters/animation per frames/skill animations you want
